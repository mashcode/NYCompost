NYCompost
=========

New York City expects to extend the voluntary pilot household composting program to the entire city by 2016. It will be critical to provide accurate and up-to-date information on the location and collection points of organic waste. 

<!--
Even more important will be the development of the tools and methods to monitor the health of organic compost.

*Phase 1*

The first step in this project is to map the compost collection and drop-off locations within the city. 

In parallel, we intend to prototype an inexpensive and portable temperature sensor to monitor the health of compost piles by transmitting data in real-time to a cloud database and using a simple publish/subscribe pattern like Yo, alert waste managers to temperature extremes, providing a link to the appropriate remediation information.
