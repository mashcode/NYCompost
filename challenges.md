Urban Decay -- Challenges
=========

Development of an open platform to address organic waste diversion is immediately disruptive. Large cities that will have to rely on human relationships within neighborhood networks and direct contact with government services . Period. 

The data generated and collected will be mapped. Development of an app and measuring device designed to easily locate and identify basic activity and environmental data will present challenges in marketing & privacy. New York City for example is about the street. Life is on the street. The home is a sanctuary. Placemeters approach is I think a great model.

Is 100% food scrap diversion into compost necessary and perhaps counter productive? Are there other by-products.
