Urban Decay -- Challenges
=========

Development of an open platform to address organic waste diversion is immediately disruptive. Which is disruptive. Large population centers will have to rely on human relationships within neighborhood networks and direct contact with government services. 

The data generated and collected will be mapped. Development of an app and measuring device designed to easily locate and identify basic activity and environmental data will present challenges in marketing & privacy. New York City for example is about the street -- life happens on the street. The home is a sanctuary. Placemeters approach is I think a great model.

Is 100% food scrap diversion into compost necessary? Are there other by-products?
