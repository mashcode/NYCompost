Urban Decay -- Challenges
=========

Development of an open platform to track organic waste diversion is immediately disruptive. Which is...disruptive. Large population centers will have to rely on human relationships within neighborhood networks and virtual contact with government services. 

Data generated and collected will be mapped. Development of an app and measuring device designed to easily locate and plot basic activity and environmental data will present challenges between propaganda & privacy. New York City for example is about the street -- life happens on the street. The home is the sanctuary. [Placemeter's](http://placemeter.com/about) approach is I think a great model.

Is 100% food scrap diversion into compost even necessary? Are there other by-products?
