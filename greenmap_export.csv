This organization created the Open Green Map platform!
Some of the eco-smart things done in the office include: recycling of all paper, glass and metal, plastic bottles, toner cartridges and electronics; house plants for better air quality; reused furniture; bike parking space indoors. Our lighting is mostly on dimmers and kept low, and we unplug the fridge in winter and set the things we need to keep cool outdoors. We offset our electricity with wind power. We choose recycled or FCS paper and try to design to minimize waste. Most the staff is vegetarian or vegan, and we all use public transport or bike to work. Green Map is a member of local and global networks that promote sustainability, too. 
Green Map System supports local Green Mapmakers as they create perspective-changing community ‘portraits’ which act as comprehensive inventories for decision-making and as practical guides for residents and tourists. Mapmaking teams pair our adaptable tools and universal iconography with local knowledge and leadership to chart green living, ecological, social and cultural resources.’
绿地图系统利用绘图作为媒介来促进世界各地可持续发展社区的包容性参与。此组织同时创造了开放式绿地图平台。
一些在办公室内推广的环保行动包括：所有纸张，玻璃，金属，塑料瓶，打印机墨盒，以及电子设备的回收；提升室内空气质量的室内绿植，再利用的家具，室内自行车停放处。办公室市内的灯光大多是可调式的，并且保持较低的光线，在冬天我们会拔掉冰箱插销并将需要冷藏的东西放在室外。我们通过风力来抵销耗费的电力。我们同时选择可回收或者森林管理委员会认证的纸张并尽可能的减少浪费。办公室的员工大多是素食主义者甚至严格素食主义者，并坚持使用公共交通或者骑车的方式来上班。绿地图同时也是当地及全球网络种宣传可持续发展的一员。
绿地图系统可以帮助各地绿地图绘制者创作出可改变观念的社区“肖像”，为决策提供全面的社区档案清单，并为居民及游客提供使用的导览。地图绘制团队将我们易用的工具，及全球通用的图标与他们的本地知识及领导层结合, 绘制出有绿色生活，生态，社会，及文化特性的资源。","","Appointment needed","Not child friendly","Volunteer Opportunities are Available","","Accessible by public transport","The nearest subway is the 2nd ave stop on the F-V.

The world-famous Union Square Greenmarket began with just a few farmers in 1976, has grown exponentially over the past 35 years: in peak season, 140 regional farmers, fishermen, and bakers descend upon Union Square to sell their products to a devout legion of city dwellers who support local agriculture with their food dollars.
As Greenmarket's flagship market, the seasonal bounty is unparalleled, with hundreds of varieties to choose from during any given season. From just-picked fresh fruits and vegetables, to heritage meats and award-winning farmstead cheeses, artisan breads, jams, pickles, a profusion of cut flowers and plants, wine, ciders, maple syrup and much more.

Located outside the entrance of historic Fort Greene Park and surrounded by chestnut trees and centuries-old brownstones, the bustling Fort Greene market serves a diverse community of young, urban professionals and multi-generational Fort Greene families who gather every Saturday, year-round, to mingle and shop for everything from micro greens to affordable staples like potatoes, onions and vegetables grown in Orange Countys famous black-dirt region. Fresh seafood, cheese, orchard fruit, baked goods, a variety of sustainably raised meat, and dairy products are available as well as wine pressed from Long Island grapes.  
------------------------
Shop local at the Greenmarket to keep NYC and its bioregion green. By shopping here, you will also be eating seasonally and reducing the impacts of transporting produce to your table. You will be supporting small family farmers as you experience the season's change and enjoy the scent of herbs and locally-grown flowers, too!
Greenmarkets provide farmers in the region with a chance to sell their produce directly to you, so it's fresher and more vitamin-rich. Every item has a clearly marked price (and there are end-of-the-day bargains, too). Produce that is organically grown or bio-dynamically raised is noted. Each Greenmarket is a great place to meet the people who grow your food – they are wonderful community gathering points, too.
Check the manager's table for information. Some locations accept drop offs of recyclable textiles or food scraps for composting. Others have cooking demonstrations, tastings, and other events. A few even sell produce grown inside NYC in a city farm, a new trend with many eco-benefits for the community!

The garden has been a public space that is multigenerational and multicultural for over two decades in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn. The garden is named after a prominent Brooklyn environmentalist who was instrumental in planting over 1,500 trees in Brooklyn.  In the mid-90s the garden received preserved landmark status as a result of the community's organizing efforts and became an Operation Greenthumb Parks & Recreation site. The Hattie Carthan Garden is an important public space with  its own legacy and history.  The garden is equipped with a recently built children's learning garden, mushroom patches, new chicken coops, a three bin composting system and vermicomposting system. There are currently 60 members on the books, 45 individual plots, a large herb garden, a host of flower beds and islands, and fruit trees (fig, peach, apple, plum, sour cherry and apricot). Two thirds of the garden is dedicated to food production. 
In the greenhouse and coldframes, seeds are propagated and nurtured until planting time. The compost piles, created from food waste and other natural materials, contribute nutrients which are essential to building healthy soil. Chemical-free plant care, and permaculture principles demonstrate practical techniques for a variety of visitors.
Food grown in our hoophouse and designated market plots is sold in the market to ensure the market is a sustainable venture.

The Rauschenbusch Metro Ministries (RMM) Composting Program seeks to convert organic waste generated in our programs as well as partner organizations' (Bank Street Head Start West, Metro Baptist Church, Hell's Kitchen Farm Project) programs into compost for use in the Hell's Kitchen Farm Project's rooftop farm located on the rooftop of RMM/Metro Baptist's offices.  RMM and Bank Street Head Start West are both housed in Metro Baptist Church.  These programs, along with RMM's resident staff, generate a tremendous amount of organic waste through two daily meals, daily snacks, community meals, personal meals, and paper waste.  At present the organizations do not compost organic waste, therefore, 100% of all organic waste is trashed.  Our dreams for the future are to grow our composting capabilities to serve as a site where community members can bring their organic waste to compost.","","Appointment not needed","Not child friendly","No Volunteer Opportunities","","Not accessible by public transport","","212-594-4464","","Free entry","","http://rmmnyc.org/","Not accessible","410 West 40th St","","New York","New York","United States","10018","40.757398","-73.994217","Green Map NYC, NYC Compost Green Map","1561, 366","Yes","No","","","","","","","","Yes"

The Hort is at the forefront of New York City’s and the nation’s growing focus on environmental concerns, green technology and urban agriculture; our interconnected programs promote the art and science of horticulture, and its vital role in contemporary life, to diverse communities across the five boroughs.
The Hort's programs use horticulture to provide job training, science and literacy learning, and mental and emotional healing to men and women who are incarcerated on Rikers Island and after they reenter society; to adults with special needs, to families and children in underserved neighborhoods; to at-risk youth; and to the people served by our partner social service and health organizations.
The Hort installs and sustains learning gardens in spaces surrounding branch public libraries, and provides hands-on science and literacy education programs in public schools and in green spaces. The Hort’s 12,000-volume research library is accessible and free to the public. Our Exhibitions Program presents bold exhibitions of contemporary artists who utilize the natural world. At our innovative multi-use space on West 37th Street and at other sites around the City we provide engaging public programs and individual horticultural services to NYC’s urban gardeners and botanical enthusiasts.","","Appointment not needed","Not child friendly","Volunteer Opportunities are Available","http://hsny.org/support_volunteer.html","Accessible by public transport","Visit us at 148 West 37th Street, 13th Floor, between Broadway and 7th Avenue.
