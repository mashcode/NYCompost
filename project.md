Urban Decay -- Project
=========

City food scrap collection & compost sites. Map, monitor & message. Activism. Disruption.

Separating organic matter from household trash is the first step in changing ingrained habits of what we eat and what we buy. It immediately changes the food chain, system wide by bringing into clearer view our other contribution to the waste stream -- plastic.

Cities are moving to mandatory organic waste diversion and composting programs. It will be critical to provide accurate and up-to-date information on the location and collection points of organic waste. Missing is the data to inform  and track participation in food scrap diversion and composting. Harnessing the human energy will be essential to the projects success.

# The best laid plans...rely on technology

One could argue we are at a place in time where the science is in yet the existing methods to put that science to good effect are lagging far behind. Global warming is here but are we?

It falls on recycling, sigh, to mitigate the environmental burden of human food waste and it's mixed bag of technical and biological product. Conservation efforts inch along. Many of us, in our heart of hearts, believe in recycling and conservation yet our inner autonomous consumer is conflicted at the expense of rational thought. Cheese curls are forever my Waterloo. Many of the many actively participate while overlooking the considerable energy spent creating and distributing the stuff we end up separating. A cities food has often traveled thousands of kilometers before ending up rotting in refrigeration. Carbon +1. The verticality and population density of urban zones pose unique sets of conditions that need to be addressed.

In our use case, measuring Food(scraps) to Compost, technology both is and is not the answer. Food waste being a wholly user-centered experience will require wholly user-centered intervention. We all know, as much as we try to ignore it, what we are throwing into our waste cans. YouTube mutts, while entertainingly loyal and cute table scrap diverters, as alternative digesters should *not* be scalable. The platform should be knitted around "open by design" and with any luck disappear into the background.

All designed information systems are at their root human systems and can only function through the relationships of the people within those systems. Social applications, by example, take on the structure of woven materials much like brain neural networks. We use patterns to make associations. What kills any great idea, besides bad timing, is a design so onerous it suffocates the ability of people to create relationships and community within that system. I experience this every time I'm encouraged to log into LinkedIn and Google+. I'm sorry, I don't mean to pile on, but wtf?

So the food(scraps) to compost story aka Compost Club is obviously one of science and observation, the conversion of energy through decay, but it's also a story about converting human energy, enabling and building out the interchanges within neighborhoods and being accountable for everything in our waste stream. Lastly, it's about changing long ingrained habits. The tools are readily available to support collaboration, share activity and most importantly provide the channels to connect with each other. At this point we have no choice but to.

Look at the center of any disruptive idea, you'll always find an activist core.

## Question, questions

* What is food(scrap) diversion participation over time? Is there even data to even measure this? If not, can it be inferred by other means?

## Inputs

* Metadata
* Data
* Tests
* Surveys and polls

## Rules of Compost Club
* Rule 1 process what you preach 
* Rule 2 process what you preach close to where you preach
* Rule 3 relationships ~ trust
* Rule 4 for {measure ~ data ~ truth} ####The Welty Matrix
* Rule 5 else Rule 1

## Some Assumptions

* My planet will have soil, air and water free of man-made chemical pollutants.
* Reduce ~ Reuse ~ Recycle must be replaced with Waste-free
* Planned obsolescence must die!
* Global climate changes profound impact on water resources is a visible threat that crosses all geographic zones.
* Cities are food scrap machines. Using economies of scale can facilitate a  consistent & reliable product. Doh.
* Adding composted organic matter will innoculate, improve water retention and provide plant nutrients.
* Soils rich in beneficial organisms become a carbon sponge.
* Compost is a natural "nearly free" resource unlike water.

## Possible Outcomes

* Creative ideation
* Data, Datasets & APIs
* Explore sensors
* GCFS (General Compost Standard;)
* Maps, maps, maps
* Viz, viz, visualization
* Embedded chat/messaging
* A complex system doesn't mean we can't have fun
